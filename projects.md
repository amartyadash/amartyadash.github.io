### [Comparing DNN Features With Psychological Representations](https://bcs.sntiitk.in/projects/2020/07/01/Comparing-Deep-Neural-Network-Features-With-Psychological-Representations.html)
#### May 2020 - Jul 2020

SnT Summer Project — Brain and Cognitive Society, IITK

* Won the Best Research Award amongst 35+ projects and over 400 participants in SnT Summer Camp ‘20

*  Successfully reproduced the results in the paper ‘Adapting Deep Network Features to Capture Psychological Representations’

* Applied a Ridge Regression on the feature-by-object matrix to obtain a similarity matrix with high R2 Performance

* Extracted Deep Network Features from 120 images using both Keras & PyTorch models of VGG-16, GoogLeNet & AlexNet

### [D.R.D.O.’s SASE UAV Fleet Challenge](https://github.com/AerialRobotics-IITK/inter_iit_uav_fleet)
#### Dec 2019

Inter IIT Tech Meet 8.0, IIT Roorkee

* Secured the 1st Position and the Gold Medal, with a perfect score of 400/400
* Implemented a Swarm Architecture using the FKIE Multimaster framework for intra-fleet tracking of detected boxes
* Worked with Mapping APIs (Bing Maps REST API, OpenLayers, Folium) to mark detected boxes on a map


### [International Micro Aerial Vehicle Competition (IMAV), 2019](https://github.com/AerialRobotics-IITK/imav2019)
#### Sep 2019 - Oct 2019

Madrid, Spain

* Amongst the top 15 teams selected globally for the Outdoor Challenge
* Developed a fleet of MAVs capable of detecting mailboxes and delivering packages into them across an area of 30,000 sq.m
* Implemented a robust Helipad Detection and landing framework for the mission
* Carried out rigorous Hardware-Integration testing and handled the Ground Station operations during the competition
