* Recieved Pre-Placement Offer Based on the performance in this internship
* Designed a Production Credit (PC) calculation framework to better represent the value of client flow in FX option trades
* Replaces the current method of awarding a fixed percentage of the spread as PC to sales with a model that gives a PC value based on the P&L profile of the client and liquidity of the currency pair
* Worked closely with a team of FX options quant traders and e-trading quants to develop a novel half-life exponential decay model that captures PC for any aggregate P&L profile
* Refactored the codebase for integration into the companyâ€™s analytics chatbot, AI Markets
