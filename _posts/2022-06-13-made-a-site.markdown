Spent a total of 4 hours trying to figure out how to go about making a site. Tried to go through HTML and CSS (not my forte). Jekyll seemed the least complicated to my monke brain, hence here we are.

I guess this is my first blog post. Definitely will try to write some stuff here and also present my self-projects here.

Site made with â˜• and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
